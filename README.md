# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set.
2. a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
3. The README that explains the analysis filesÂ  
4. R scripts

The script 'run_analysis.R' does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
